# docker-fp-course [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/irreverent-pixel-feats/docker-fp-course.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/irreverent-pixel-feats/docker-fp-course)

A docker container setup to run [this fork](https://github.com/domdere/fp-course) of the
[Data61 FP Course](https://github.com/data61/fp-course).

We use this when running people through the course sometimes.

Nix etc.. are also other good options, this image is a snapshot with pre-cached built deps
so hopefully you can just mount the repo and go straight away.
